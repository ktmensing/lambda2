Last night was the last bash at 73.5. Ever. Check out some of the evidence."Little know fact...DW actually inspired the early personal style of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Nielsen"">Rick Nielsen</a> .

But this story is liable to give you a fright. 28 Days after initiating a recycling program in our office, it seems there is a lack of effort in actually GETTING the recyclable goods to the plant.""At Blue Ion, we've always been advocates of alternative transportation. Of course, people drive to work primarily... but collectively we've walked, rode bikes, carpooled with other employees, and even taken CARTA from time to time. Much to our surprise, CS, one of our star Alt-Transport team members recently showed up on this!"RY's beard has been growing since November... with very little trimming for the last few months. Usually it's off by now for concern over the sweltering heat and when the NJ Devils end up losing in the NHL playoffs (far too often over the past few years).We have completed Phase 1 and picked some collective winners."The Civil War Era beard configuration was seemingly a hit. I can't imagine that I was taken seriously in much of his interactions, whether with clients in meetings, co-workers, at restaurants, stores, or even with the ladies. However, some old folks down here in the South gave some props to relating well, considering some of their Fathers and Grandfathers probably had a similar fantastic beard style back when they were young.""Even as we whittle down the beard, there are still some very creative designs for me to choose from. I would have liked to go with the <a href=""http://beard.blueion.com/upload/1221619510841701.jpg"" target=""_blank"">Reverse Cat Tail</a> and Mr. 3.14159265... had a <a href=""http://beard.blueion.com/upload/49501719510841701.jpg"" target=""_blank"">nice Pi design</a>. But at the end of the day, I had to go with a bit of the old handlebar action."And so it ends.... here were are.. the end of days for the beard. Hello summer sun on my clean shaven face.What is Guerrilla Cuisine?_"<p>Over the course of several months, the Blue Ion blog has slowly turned from a fun and wacky commentary on what is happening in the Blue Ion world, to .... eeeh, not so much.</p>""<p>At the expense of sounding like a grumpy, old man (I assure you I have only one of those qualities), I need to complain/comment on yet another issue with our airlines.</p>""Like many of the great artists that preceded him, and very likely, sadly, will come after him, Anton Maiden was someone that died at a much too young age.""<p>We are (finally) moving to a <a href=""http://301.blueion.com"" target=""_blank"">PERMANENT HOME</a>!</p>""<p>I've been looking for a new roommate to occupy the house I'm currently renting. One of my roommates is moving out April 1st. So, as I've done in the past, I've looked to Craigslist...posting an ad for a roommate. It's worked well in the past. But, as everyone should be aware of now, Craiglist is a breeding ground for attempted scam attempts. It still blows my mind that the method they use to try and scam people ... the long, convoluted road to separating you from your hard-earned money ... works on anyone.</p>"<p>It's Trivia Time at Blue Ion.

I decree that these are the 3 Main Reasons the Auto Industry is failing.""Everyone has horror stories when it comes to big, monopolistic, soulless companies. It's a theme that reverberates throughout the internet.... posting flames about some do-wrong, feelings of helplessness, bitching about the lack of effort or care, and finally, satisfaction of leaving the business for good. This story is not much different from others you may have read about, or had happen to you personally. But I feel it's my duty to post yet another horror story, and those that know me(us) personally will hopefully understand that it's well worth dumping AT&amp;T as soon as possible._""Eat your heart out, Simpo..."Craig showed up today in a new (temporary) ride.Is something missing for you from the Blue Ion Blog?<strong>THE SEAS ARE UNDER SIEGE!</strong>"It's that time again.... my favorite time of year... mid-April. The NHL Regular season comes to a close, and final playoff spots are jostled around till they're set for the ""2nd Season."" ""Many of you know, Theodore is extremely resourceful. And it's no secret, ""there's more than one way to skin a cat""[<a href=""#1"">1</a>]. So, when yours truly was caught in a tight spot during this weekend's move to the new offices at 301 King, my problem solving instinct kicked in immediately. Lemme explain...""With less than a week away from the start of the World Cup, everyone's buzzing at the Blue Ion offices. After all 33.3333% (repeating, of course) of our current workforce are active footballers, along with one retired footballer, and yet another straight from the land of the beautiful game.[1]""I'm sorry. It's been a while since you've heard from Theodore's Corner. Needless to say, I've been busy doing stuff, but still collecting tons of meta-data to share with my rabid followers.""<strong>I'm not a doctor, but I play one on the internet.</strong>"A real quick precursor to the weekend...Looking for a good movie this weekend to curl up on the couch with a bowl of popcorn?"This past Labor Day weekend, the BIFC (Blue Ion Football Club), travelled up to Asheville for the <a href=""http://www.beercitycup.info/"">Beer City Cup</a>. This was the first annual 8v8 style tournament being put on up there, and we fervently accepted the invitation extended to us to come and play. In order to create this elite squad, we pulled together most of the same players from our <a href=""http://www.blueion.com/blog/2010/06/05/tc-v-is-for-victory/"">winning Memorial Day Tournament team</a>; consisting of a handful of players from the BIFC regulars and two other teams we always compete against locally.""In this edition of Theodore's Corner of Inappros and Apropos, I'd like to focus on a few things I've run across recently cruising in the 1990 Toyota Camry. Most specifically, how the Camry handles parking in the garage.""Ok, so it's been forever (seriously like half a year) since the last Theodore's Corner post. I've had a lot going on. I apologize. So vacation from ""the Corner"" is over. I'll be rattling off several TC posts in the coming weeks that have been stewing._For this post.... Football! Errrr, I mean, Soccer!""<a href=""http://www.blueion.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/brodeur.jpg""><img title=""brodeur"" src=""http://www.blueion.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/brodeur-570x376.jpg"" alt="""" width=""570"" height=""376"" /></a>""That's right, we're looking to add yet another member to the Blue Ion programming team.

Many wings were consumed in celebration!"We're unloading a lot of our old office equipment and some other random stuff. Originally, we were going to sell this on an eCom site just for fun, but fulfilling individual sales seems WAY too much work. We're selling all sorts of stuff from our offices over the years, and after we moved to our final home on King Street a few years ago, this older stuff was set aside to eventually sell/give away to a good home.""Most people that know me, know the shortlist of obsessions and my passion for them. Sure, most people are deep rooted in their own, but I go well beyond that sometimes. Not everyone will relate, and that's fine. In this installment, I'm focused on RUSH, the 3 Prog Rock musicians from Canada, and why I consider them so great. Not to argue that they are the greatest of all time (everyone will have their opinion). But since they've been a large musical influence for me most of my life, how each of us [fans] will have many different reasons as to why it is. From favorite song, to favorite album, to most influential, to most technical, to favorite band member, or to favorite moment(s) for THAT particular fan... it's all different, and subjective, and arguable... for an obsessed RUSH fan.""We just launched a new, responsive, eCommerce site for the 4-year old brand Babiators. Since starting the business in 2010, Babiators has manufactured and sold high-quality, durable baby, toddler and child-sized sunglasses. They came to us looking to improve their brand and online marketing and sale capabilities. They're distributed and sold in over 2000 locations around the world, as well as numerous online stores. They've been featured in Forbes, Vogue magazines, as well as on TV shows such as Ellen, E!, and the Today Show.""Everyone has told you that backing up your computer is utmost importance. And of course, everyone that has ever had a hard drive fail WITHOUT a backup, generally learns that lesson the hard way. Throughout the 14 years of Blue Ion, I've had varying backup plans, starting early in our existence with running HOT with no backup plan! And we learned after Robert's laptop failed back then, and spending $1500 on a drive recovery service, that keeping on top of this is absolutely necessary. Yet, I still know of people that don't do this, when they should, even with their home computers if anything on them is important to them.""This time of year means that Spring has sprung, the daylight lasts longer, and the warm weather is finally here. For me, it also means Hockey's regular season is coming to an end, and I start looking forward to Hockey's ""second season"" ... the Stanley Cup Playoffs. This time of year usually meant, my beloved team, the New Jersey Devils, are jockeying for playoff position, watching the other teams trying to get in, or anticipating which team we'll match up best against in the first round. Unfortunately, the Devils have had some ups-and-downs the past few years, where they have missed the playoffs completely, mixed in with an unprecedented run to the Stanley Cup Finals 2 years ago, falling in 6 games to the LA Kings."Part 2"In Part 2 of the Network Attached Storage (NAS) Series, I wanted to explain some of the more specific uses of our particular NAS setup.""Ever since I was a young kid, I was into flight. I remember trying out my first <a href=""http://www.lemonamiga.com/games/details.php?id=417"" target=""_blank"">Flight Simulator II</a> on the Commodore Amiga. It came with a Pilot's Operating Handbook (POH), an Aeronautical Chart complete with VOR frequencies, and a large manual. I recognized that this was not a ""game"" but there was an art to learning how to fly properly and safely, while imagining shuttling people from one airport to another. I was 12 years old.""Blue Ion FC has joined the ranks of the 3-peat Champions by winning the Beer City Cup in Asheville this past Labor day. And if not for ""the one that slipped thru our hands"" 4 years ago, we would have had had a 5-peat this year.""I remember a trip I took to Europe back in 1999, before smartphones, but with a simple cellphone. Back then, Cell Phones weren't prevalent. I had one for my small business prior to Blue Ion getting rolling, but not too many other people had them yet. Going to Europe meant the cell phone wasn't going to work... PERIOD. There were no burner phones or Skype either. Needless to say, life was much simpler then. I just checked VoiceMail using a calling card for the more important issues while on holiday.""I'm really only weeks away from my Private Pilot's license. I've been delayed this year by too many other things going on, so I haven't been able to focus on the written exam studying. But in the meantime, I've been doing everything else I can think of to strengthen my experience in the cockpit, including landing at Charleston International (<a href=""#flying"">jump to video</a>).""Since the Blue Ion staff put out their <a href=""/blog/2016/01/07/blue-ion-new-years-resolutions/"">New Year's resolutions</a> earlier this year, I figured I'd update on my progress to remind everyone else about theirs. And see where we all stand.""Following up on <a href=""http://www.blueion.com/blog/2016/10/11/weathering-the-storm/"">Brian's post</a> regarding our experiences with the biggest Hurricane we've seen in over a decade on the Eastern Carolinas, I decided to stay put at my condo (also above the Blue Ion office). Several of my friends chose to stay in town, and really we were waiting it out to see if this storm was going to turn, hit landfall early, dissipate, in hopes of deciding we wouldn't need to evacuate. Unfortunately, Matthew was somewhat unpredictable in that it wasn't until midday Friday that it appeared it would be coming for us. And still unsure as to how hard it would be when it hit.""For my birthday (back in October), along with some very thoughtful and appreciated gifts from friends, I was given a few gag gifts from Ryan Cockrell of <a href=""http://lunchandrecess.com/"">Lunch &amp; Recess.</a> One of which was a wind up cockroach, pictured here.""Being a regular donor and supporter of the <a href=""https://www.charlestonanimalsociety.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">ASPCA</a>, <a href=""http://www.humanesociety.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Humane Society</a>, and cat-dad of two sweet/fun 5 year old cats, my girlfriend and I decided to help with the always necessary adoption and fostering needs of the Charleston Animal Society. We've never done this before, but Arielle has been following a girl up in DC (<a href=""https://www.instagram.com/kittenxlady/?hl=en"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">kittenlady</a>) that has been regularly rescuing and fostering little kittens in need. With this inspiration, we decided we'd give it a try, with the goal of also getting them adopted when they are ready to.""I was given a box of these Bean Boozled jelly beans this weekend from a friend. When I gave it a try, I managed to miss all the bad ones in 5 attempts, aside from toothpaste, which is obviously not bad. But I figured it'd be fun to bring back to the office and let everyone test their luck.""The weekend of June 15th-17th, I flew to Ponte Vedra Beach in Florida to meet up with my girlfriend, her best friend, and others, at their family vacation home there. I would be flying solo since Arielle had already gone to Atlanta and down from there with her friend."
